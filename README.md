# Smart Driver and Speed Systems

Traffic signs consist of variety of different symbols and signs. Not only that, but they are also designed in different shapes, mainly circular, rectangular, and triangular. They are specifically designed with different colours combinations of blue, red, and white to allow visibility in daytime or night-time. The purpose of traffic signs being on the road is to act as a reminder to all drivers on the road that it is important to keep to a certain speed limit on the highway, to tell the driver it is not advisable to park at a certain area or that a certain road is only for entry and not to be used for exit. Traffic signs serve the purpose to not only ensure the smooth flow of traffic on the road but also to ensure the safety of the drivers on the road as well.

This project aims to:
```
-Assisting people who may have slow reaction or cannot concentrate for long period of times
-Reducing traffic accident
-Assist drivers that has disabilities from car accidental
-Reducing healthcare cost from lower rate of car accidents that contribute to injuries
-Help in reducing environmental pollution through better driving habit
```


## Build Custom Dataset
There are multiple public datasets available online that can be downloaded to run traffic detection and recognition. Some of the traffic signs used in Brunei Darrussalam are not used in other countries. So I've decided to make a custom dataset based on the traffic signs in Brunei Darussalam to cater for this project.

## Run the dataset on existing models
Will be trying out different models to see compare the accuracy between them.

## Train the model on different hardwares
Analysis will be done to determine which is the most viable option to train the model in terms of training speed.

###### Google Colab
To train the model to determine the training time on simulation.

###### Raspberry Pi 4
Analyze the performance of the hardware.

###### Jetson TX2
